# HushHub - A Silent Disco Experience

This is a Next.js project for HushHub, a silent disco event service. It was created and is being developed in Firebase Studio.

## Downloading the Project

To work on this project locally or to keep a backup, you'll first need to download the source code. The best way to do this is by connecting a Git repository to your Firebase Studio project.

### Using Git (Recommended)

If you have connected a Git repository (like on GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket) to your Firebase Studio project, you can clone it to your local machine using the following command. This is the recommended approach for managing your code.

```bash
# Replace the URL with your repository's clone URL
git clone https://github.com/your-username/hushhub.git
cd hushhub
```

Using Git is the best way to manage changes, collaborate with others, and keep a version history.

## Getting Started Locally

Once you have the project files on your local machine, please follow these steps to set it up.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 20 or later recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (usually comes with Node.js)

### 1. Install Dependencies

Navigate to the project's root directory in your terminal and run the following command to install all the necessary packages:

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Run the Development Server

Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the local development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the Next.js application in development mode with hot-reloading. You can view the website by opening your browser and navigating to `http://localhost:9002` (or whichever port is indicated in your terminal).

### Available Scripts

- `npm run dev`: Starts the development server.
- `npm run build`: Creates a production-ready build of the application.
- `npm run start`: Starts the application from the production build.
- `npm run lint`: Runs the linter to check for code quality issues.
